# Par0047 - elastix

###  Registration Description
intra-subject; B-spline transformation; groupwise registration; PCA metric	

###  Image data

Clinical 4D dynamic contrast enhanced MR images with focus on the liver.

###  Application

Motion correction for contrast enhanced time series of the abdomen.

###  Registration settings

`elastix` version: 4.801

For Groupwise Registration PCAmetric2 was used.

###  Command line calls

For groupwise registration one should use the following command line call:


    elastix -f <4D DCE-MRI image> -m <4D DCE-MRI image> -p  -out

where <4D DCE-MRI image> is the entire group of images that are acquired in a single DCE-MRI acquisition. Note that the fixed and moving image should be the same. The fixed image is not used for the registration, but acts as a dummy to prevent elastix throwing error messages.
