# Par0044 - elastix

###  Registration Description
intra-subject; multi-image; affine (Mutual Information) + multi-image B-spline transformation (Mutual Information and mean square difference);

###  Image data

Single phase cardiac CTA acquired in diastole, slice thickness 0.4 mm, in plane resolution 0.35 mm.

* CT perfusion (reference frame from dynamic CTP sequence)

Dynamic stress CTP after adenosine acquired in end diastole. Reconstructed with a 2 mm thickness and in plane resolution of 0.35 mm using a medium-smooth B23f kernel. From the reconstructed sequence a single frame is selected based on maximum contrast and best alignment with perfusion map.

###  Application

Registration of myocardium from CTA to CT perfusion using myocardial territory labels for regularization
