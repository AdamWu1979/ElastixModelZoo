# Par0009 - elastix

###  Image data

###  Application

Registration that can be used for atlas-based segmentation of brain structures. Transformations should be saved and then applied on the atlas images to obtain a segmentation of the target image. Segmentations from different atlas images can be combined to achieve higher accuracy, as explained in [1].

###  Registration settings

`elastix` version: 4.0

Parameter files, see below

###  Published in

These registration steps are described in the publication:
