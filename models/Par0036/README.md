# Par0036 - elastix

###  Image data

* 2D joint intensity histograms of the multi-spectral multi-station whole-body MR data
* Stored in PNG format

###  Application

* The registration was used for bringing all the acquired stations into the same intensity space

![alt-text](2D-hist-elastix-wiki.png)

* Columns: different stations of the same whole-body MR volume. The reference station is highlighted in red
* First row: one slice from the T1-weighted channel
* Second row: one slice from the STIR channel
* Third row: raw joint intensity histogram of each station
* Fourth row: raw joint intensity histogram of each station after registration

###  Registration settings

`elastix` version: 4.600

Parameter files:

See Github link below.

Description:

* par0036affinedti.txt the affine registration was used to register the histogram of each station to that of the reference one
