# Par0046 - elastix

###  Image data

Three cadaveric specimens were images with a clinical-grade computed tomography scanner (Revolution HD GE Gemstone, GE Healthcare). They were older with degraded joints, making it difficult to separate the femur from the pelvis.

###  Application

Segmentation of full femurs in routine clinical computed tomography scans for large-scale analysis of population-health. See the repository on [GitHub][1] for all source code and how to compile the algorithms for comparison.
